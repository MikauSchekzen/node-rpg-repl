# node-rpg-repl

This project is aimed at creating an interactive NodeJS command line interface with some added stuff for RPGs.

## Installation

Simply run `node node-calc.js` in a command line interface to run this program.

## Usage

For now, the only command (besides help) is `roll <cmd>`, where `<cmd>` should be replaced with something like '1d6' or '1d20+15', and the program will output a dice roll.
Enter `help` to get help.
